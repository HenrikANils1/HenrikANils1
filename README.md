👋 Hi, my name is Henrik. Just got on Github.

🏗️ I'm studying constructional engineering at NTNU in Trondheim, Norway.
... want to expand my tech- and coding knowledge, but where do I even start?

Mostly interested in constructional engineering, but there's a world beyong python as well (or at least I'm told?)
Reach out to me on [LinkedIn.com/henrikanils1/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/henrikanilsen/)! I'd love to connect.
