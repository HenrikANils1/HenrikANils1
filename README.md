👋 Hi, my name is Henrik. Just got on Github.

🏗️ I'm studying constructional engineering at NTNU in Trondheim, Norway.
... want to expand my tech- and coding knowledge, but where do I even start?

Mostly interested in constructional engineering, but there's a world beyong python aswell (or at least i think so?)
